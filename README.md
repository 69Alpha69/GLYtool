# MD Simulation Free-State Analysis

This notebook provides an interactive workflow for the analysis of free-state molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, focusing on the calculation of Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) and sampling of glycosidic torsion angles.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `MD_SIM_Analysis.ipynb`  
  Main notebook for data import, format conversion, RMSD analysis, and glycosidic angle sampling.
- `trajectory.xtc` (generated)  
  Trajectory file obtained from the conversion of a multimodel PDB file.
- `analysis_results/` (generated)  
  Folder containing the analysis results (plots, PDFs, raw data, etc.).

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/)
- [mdtraj](https://mdtraj.org/)
- numpy
- matplotlib
- ipywidgets
- tqdm
- IPython

It is recommended to create a virtual environment (venv or conda) to isolate dependencies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MD-SIM-Analysis.git
cd MD-SIM-Analysis

# Create virtual environment with venv
env="mdsim-env"
python3 -m venv $env
source $env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# .\$env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create virtual environment with venv
env="mdsim-env"
python3 -m venv $env
source $env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# .\$env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##  üöÄ Usage

-  Start Jupyter Notebook:

    ```jupyter notebook```

-  Open `MD_SIM_Analysis.ipynb` in your browser.

-  Execute the cells in order:

  1. Load dependencies

  2.  Convert multimodel PDB file to trajectory.xtc

  3.  RMSD analysis with widget interface

  4. Glycosidic torsion angle sampling

-  All plots and results will be saved in the analysis_results/ folder.

##  üìù Section Description

-  Load necessary dependencies: imports libraries and modules.

-  Multimodel.pdb ‚Üí trajectory.xtc Converter: converts a multimodel PDB file into a usable XTC trajectory file.

-  Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) Analysis: calculates and visualizes RMSD relative to a reference structure.

-  Glycosidic Torsion Angle Sampling: performs distributional sampling of glycosidic angles (phi/psi) throughout the simulation.

##  üìà Results

Interactive plots within the notebook

Automatic export to PNG, SVG, PDF via matplotlib
